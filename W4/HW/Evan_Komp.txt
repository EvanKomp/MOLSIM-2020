1). Running the system with 65 particles at a density of 0.25. The temperature
was raised and the particles were observed to remain in a packed structure until
the temperature was ~0.3. At this point the spacing between neighbors began to
significantly differ between timesteps, this is assumed to be liquid. The particles remain mostly in a clust together until a temperature of ~0.55 at which point they disperse and do not really maintain any sort of structure.

2). When the system does not start in a packed arrangement, it is very difficult to
get all particles into one solid. From a mobile (high temperature) state, if the
temperature is reduced to quickly the particles will form seperate clusters without
the energy required to reach eachother. Instead the temperature has to be lessened very slowly and methodically to allow the particles to transition into clustering together.
This way they go through a state where they begin to clump but still have the energy required to reach other clumps.

3). The lowest emergy per particle can be achieved at highest density and a low number of particles
~50 at low temperature. The energy is very variant based on the random initial starting postition,
I think due to the shape of the clusters forming. For this reason I don't think using a small system is representative. 
At a large number of particles there is a much shorter variance, and is more representative (averages out outlier). This more representative value of lowest energy (N = 1000, density =max, temperature =min) is about -30/poarticle.

4). Yes, it takes a higher temperature to liquify the system with many atoms, this is
because for a large system there is more energy associated with packing, and with
many atoms the overall tendancy to cluster is higher.
