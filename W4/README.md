# HW Assignment #4 

In this assignment, you will go through a basic 2D simulation of Lennard-Jones spheres. This simulation is from the NetLogo, a multi-agent programmable modeling environment. Part of this enviroment includes Models Library that includes a Lennard-Jones 2D simulation. 

It works better if you download the package onto your computer instead of working from the browser, but try the one that works best for you.  

Details about the simulation and to downlaod it can be found [here.](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Lennard-Jones)

Once downloaded (I got NetLogo version 6.1.1), go to Files > Models Library > Chemistry & Physics > Lennard-Jones

It will loaad the Lennard-Jones simulation. 

On the website, there is a "THINGS TO TRY" section. Please submit a file (.doc, .txt, .md files are fine) that answer the 4 questions in the "Things to try in the model". You do not have to do the "Things to try outside the model to explore the Lennard-jones potential." 

Please upload files in the HW directory

HW is due NEXT THURSDAY 02/06/2020
