```
1.) Create a bash script that accomplishes the following tasks: 

1.) For a number n which ranges from 1 to 100 perform the following conditional actions:

- If n is odd, print "Odd"
- If n is even and in the inclusive range of 5 to 9, print "Even and Blue"
- If n is even and in the inclusive range of 10 to 20, print "Even and Red"
- If n is even and greater than 60 print "Potato"

In the same script, you will also print all odd numbers to a file called "yourname_odd.txt", and all even numbers to a  file called "yourname_even.txt" 

2.) Make the script executable, run your script, and direct the output to a file titled "yourname.txt" 

3.) Upload all three text files to github, as well as your script which should be titled `yourname.sh`
